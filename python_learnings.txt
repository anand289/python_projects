Excersise 1:
    
To iterate though elements: 
    for i in list:

To iterate through element numbers:
 	for i in range(0,len(list)): # if length is 5, will iterate from 0-->4
     
    for i in range(0,n): # if first element is 0, it will iterate n times, till n-1.
        
    range[l,r) # left element is included, right element is excluded. 
          
          
To remove any element of a list: pop will modify the original list
    list.pop(index)
    
Excersise 2:
    
    list2 = list1 
    
    both the lists starts sharing the same address. 
    changing list1 will change list2, or visa-versa. 
    use copy if don't want this
    

Excersice 3:
    
    recursive function --> think in terms of mathematical function. 
    write fabonacci and factorial using recursive
    python functions can manupilate variables defined outside then from inside the variable. 
    copy lists to modify one independent of other. 
    
    
Exercise 4: 
    
    sum(list[a:b]) produces sum of elements of the list from a to b. a included, b exclueded.
